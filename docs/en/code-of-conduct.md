# Code of Conduct

[In Russian](https://kotlinby.github.io/kotlin-telegram/code-of-conduct/)

## This Code of Conduct helps us build a community that is rooted in kindness, collaboration, and mutual respect.

> This document is based on [StackOverflow Code of Conduct](https://stackoverflow.com/conduct).

Whether you’ve come to ask questions or to generously share what you know, join us in building a community where all people feel welcome and can participate, regardless of expertise or identity.

We commit to enforcing and improving the Code of Conduct. It applies to everyone participating in [@kotlin_lang](https://t.me/kotlin_lang), [@kotlin_mobile](https://t.me/kotlin_mobile), [@kotlin_jvm](https://t.me/kotlin_jvm), [@kotlin_js](https://t.me/kotlin_js), [@kotlin_meta](https://t.me/kotlin_meta), moderators, and anyone posting to mentioned chats.

## Our Expectations

**If you’re here to get help, make it as easy as possible for others to help you.** [Follow guidelines on asking questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and remember that our community is made possible by volunteers.

**If you’re here to help others, be patient and welcoming.** Learning how to participate in our community can be hard. Offer support if you see someone struggling or otherwise in need of help.

**Be clear and constructive when giving feedback, and be open when receiving it.** Edits, comments, and suggestions are healthy parts of our community.

**Be kind and friendly.** Avoid sarcasm and be careful with jokes — tone is hard to decipher online. If a situation makes it hard to be friendly, stop participating and move on.

## Unacceptable Behavior

**No subtle put-downs or unfriendly language.** Even if you don’t intend it, this can have a negative impact on others.

| Unfriendly | Friendly |
| ---------- | -------- |
| ❌ “You could Google this in 5 seconds.”.| ✔️ “This is called Invariance and Covariance. If you Google it, you’ll find tutorials that can explain it much better than we can in an answer here.”. |
| ❌ “If you bothered to read my question, you’d know it’s not a duplicate.”.| ✔️ “I don’t think this is a duplicate. My question is about cement board, while the question you linked is about drywall.”. |
| ❌ “Are you speaking English? If so, I can’t tell.”.| ✔️ “I’m having trouble understanding your question. I think you’re asking how to add a swap after system installation. Is that correct?”. |
| ❌ “I came to get help, not to get my question edited.”.| ✔️ “Thanks for trying to help, but your edit isn’t what I meant. I’ve removed your edit, and have updated my question so it’s clearer.”. |

**No name-calling or personal attacks.** Focus on the content, not the person. This includes terms that feel personal even when they're applied to content (e.g. “lazy”).

**No bigotry.** We don’t tolerate any language likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples. When in doubt, just don’t.

**No harassment.** This includes, but isn’t limited to: bullying, intimidation, vulgar language, direct or indirect threats, sexually suggestive remarks, patterns of inappropriate social contact, and sustained disruptions of discussion.

## Reporting

Every person contributes to building a kind, respectful community. If you find unacceptable behavior directed at yourself or others, you can [contact us](https://t.me/kotlin_meta). We’ll respond as quickly as we can.

## Enforcement

We take your reports seriously. Those who don’t follow the Code of Conduct ***in good faith*** may face repercussions deemed appropriate by our moderation team. This is how moderators generally handle misconduct:

1. **Warning**. For most first-time misconduct, moderators will remove offending content and send a warning. Most issues are resolved here.

2. **Temporarily limit ability to post messages**. For repetitive misconduct or behavior containing harassment, bigotry, or abuse, moderators will impose a temporary posting restriction (one day or more, depending on the violation).

3. **Restrict posting messages forever**. For very rare cases, moderators will expel people who display a pattern of harmful destructive behavior toward our community.

All actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of our moderators. If you have concerns about how a moderator has handled a situation, [contact us](https://t.me/kotlin_meta) directly.

We created this Code of Conduct because it reinforces the respect that we, as a community, expect from one another. Having a code also provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it stray off-course.

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of what we do at Stack Overflow and the Stack Exchange network. Thank you for working with us to build a kind, collaborative, and respectful community.
